There were also other categories in the data set such as employee name, agency title and job title. With the salaries and 
other information there were a lot of ideas and questions that could have been answered. We as a group wanted to see exactly
how these salaries compared to one another from the different departments we have in this state. We showed this in a couple
different visual representations. We dug even further and decided to analyze and show a visual representation of just UW salaries
because we were curious on how the salaries matched with one another to the school we attend at. In conclusion, there are a lot of
jobs in Washington State and at the University of Washington and we visually wanted to see what these categorized salaries looked 
like when they are put up next to each other."),

and how although the average UW employee with the title “President” earns more than the average athletics coach, the head football coach
has by far the highest salary of any employee at UW and even in the state. Coach Sarkisian earned 33 times the average professor at UW and
52 times the average engineer. This shows a disparity between the amount of schooling and hard work necessary in each field and the salaries
of employees in those fields.")
